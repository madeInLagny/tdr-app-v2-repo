					<p>Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is a provision of U.S. trade law that authorizes the President to take action, including the imposition of tariffs, to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements and to respond to certain unfair trade practices by foreign countries. The term 'Trump Tariffs' refers to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under this authority. During his mandates, Donald Trump used Section 301 to impose tariffs on a wide range of goods, particularly targeting China. These tariffs were intended to address issues such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer. The tariffs affected billions of dollars worth of goods, including steel, aluminum, and a variety of consumer products.</p>
